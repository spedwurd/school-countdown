a simple school/summer countdown. if you want to test between summer/school pages, go to line 39/40 and set the "today" date to whatever you want
click the big number to swap between days, weeks, months, and hours
click the term ('days', 'weeks', etc.) to get strictly school numbers (if its on the school page).

i've strictly set it to the school page but yeah
